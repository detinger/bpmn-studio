# BPMN Studio design language

This guide captures the app's implemented visual language so it can be transferred to another product. Preserve the typography, color roles, density, surface hierarchy, and interaction patterns; replace the product name, navigation, illustrations, and domain-specific content.

Values below come from the source styles and components. Sections marked **Transfer recommendation** describe guidance for the receiving app rather than behavior already guaranteed by BPMN Studio.

## 1. Character and principles

The interface is a calm, compact workspace for learning and analytical work. Cool gray backgrounds, bordered white or dark slate surfaces, blue actions, small outline icons, and restrained orange highlights give it its identity.

- **Keep the work prominent.** Diagrams, explanations, forms, and results occupy most of the screen. Navigation and controls provide a quiet frame.
- **Use density with structure.** Compact controls sit in clearly grouped toolbars; larger gaps separate sections. Borders and spacing establish hierarchy before shadows do.
- **Give color a job.** Blue identifies actions and selection; orange highlights special activity or milestones; semantic colors explain outcomes.
- **Explain alongside action.** Place hints, validation, empty states, and next steps near the relevant task.
- **Treat both themes as complete designs.** Surfaces, controls, charts, and embedded workspaces all change together.

To retain this character, avoid oversized marketing headings, decorative gradients, glass effects, heavy shadows on every surface, or pill-shaped primary controls. Pills belong to badges, filters, and step indicators.

## 2. Color tokens

Use semantic CSS variables throughout components. Keep palette values in a central theme layer. A token's role stays the same when its value changes between themes.

### Surfaces and text

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--bg` | `#f4f6f9` | `#0f141b` | Application background |
| `--bg-elevated` | `#ffffff` | `#171e27` | Navigation, cards, controls, dialogs |
| `--bg-subtle` | `#eef1f5` | `#1c2430` | Quiet grouping, table headers, neutral fills |
| `--bg-sunken` | `#e6eaf0` | `#121821` | Recessed tracks, such as progress bars |
| `--bg-hover` | `#e9eef5` | `#233042` | Hovered rows and controls |
| `--border` | `#d6dce5` | `#2b3645` | Default 1px dividers and outlines |
| `--border-strong` | `#b7c1cf` | `#3b4a5e` | Stronger outlines and hover borders |
| `--text` | `#17202c` | `#e6ebf1` | Main content and headings |
| `--text-muted` | `#4b5867` | `#b2bdcb` | Descriptions, labels, inactive navigation |
| `--text-subtle` | `#6b7787` | `#8a97a8` | Metadata, hints, secondary annotations |
| `--text-on-primary` | `#ffffff` | `#0b1520` | Text and icons on solid primary fills |

### Brand and interaction

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--primary` | `#1f5f8b` | `#5aa7d8` | Main actions, links, focus borders, selection |
| `--primary-hover` | `#184d72` | `#7ab9e3` | Solid primary button hover |
| `--primary-soft` | `#e3eef7` | `#16314a` | Selected navigation, controls, explanatory panels |
| `--primary-strong` | `#123b59` | `#a8d3ef` | Emphasized text within primary-tinted content |
| `--accent` | `#d9822b` | `#f0a457` | Special actions, active simulation, achievements |
| `--accent-soft` | `#fbeedd` | `#3a2a17` | Soft accent badges |

Solid accent buttons and simulation banners use dark text `#1d1205` in both themes. Do not assume every saturated background takes white text.

### Semantic feedback

| Role | Foreground light / dark | Soft background light / dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Error | `#c0392b` / `#f2776a` | `#fbe9e7` / `#3b1d1a` | Failure, invalid input, destructive action |
| Warning | `#b7791f` / `#e8b45a` | `#fdf3dc` / `#3a2d14` | Caution, incomplete state, potential problem |
| Recommendation | `#2b6cb0` / `#79b2ec` | `#e6f0fa` / `#172a40` | Advice, explanation, suggested improvement |
| Info | `#5a6779` / `#a3afbf` | `#eef1f5` / `#1f2833` | Neutral information and metadata |
| Success | `#2f855a` / `#6fcf97` | `#e3f4ea` / `#16301f` | Completion, correct answers, improved outcomes |

Tokens follow `--error` / `--error-soft`, `--warning` / `--warning-soft`, and the same pattern for the other roles. Informational **callouts** deliberately use the blue recommendation palette; neutral information **badges** use the gray info palette.

Pair semantic colors with readable labels or recognizable icons. Improvement and deterioration depend on the metric: a lower duration may be good, while a lower completion count may be bad.

## 3. Typography

```css
--font-sans: 'Inter', 'IBM Plex Sans', system-ui, -apple-system,
  'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'IBM Plex Mono', ui-monospace,
  SFMono-Regular, Menlo, monospace;
```

The app declares these stacks without loading custom sans or monospace font files. The displayed font therefore depends on local availability. **Transfer recommendation:** self-host Inter and the desired monospace font if matching typography across machines is important; include the weights used below.

| Element | Size | Weight | Other properties |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Body | 14px | 400 | Line height 1.5 |
| Home hero heading | 32px | 650 | Tracking `-0.02em` |
| Page heading / h1 | 26px | 650 | Tracking `-0.01em` |
| Section heading / h2 | 20px | 650 | Tracking `-0.01em` |
| Card heading / h3 | 16px | 650 | Tracking `-0.01em` |
| Subheading / h4 | 14px | 650 | Tracking `-0.01em` |
| Dialog heading | 17px | 650 | No bottom margin |
| Hero description | 15px | 400 | Muted text |
| Compact content / table body | 13px | 400 | Also used in side panels |
| Field label / table heading | 12px | 600 | Muted text |
| Hint | 12px | 400 | Subtle text |
| Small metadata / badge | 11px | 400 / 650 | Keep secondary |
| KPI value | 22px | 700 | Tracking `-0.02em`, tabular numerals |
| Eyebrow | 12px | 600 | Uppercase, tracking `0.08em`, primary color |
| Navigation group label | 11px | 400 | Uppercase, tracking `0.06em` |

Headings use line height 1.25 and bottom margin `0.5em`. Paragraphs use bottom margin `0.75em`. Body text remains sentence case; uppercase is reserved for short group labels and eyebrows.

Use monospace for code, identifiers, traces, and keyboard shortcuts. Inline `code` and `kbd` are `0.92em`. Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for metrics, numeric table columns, zoom values, and comparisons. Explanatory prose is limited to `76ch`; page-header descriptions to `72ch`.

## 4. Spacing, shape, and elevation

Spacing is currently expressed as literal CSS values, not a named spacing-token system. These recurring values form the practical scale:

| Spacing | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| 2–4px | Tight internal grouping, badge gaps, adjacent toolbar controls |
| 6px | Icon-to-label gaps, compact list gaps |
| 8px | Standard row gaps, small control padding |
| 10–12px | Form grids, compact surface padding, field separation |
| 14–16px | Panel padding, standard stacks and card-grid gaps |
| 18px | Default card and dialog-body padding |
| 20–24px | Page-header separation, larger layout gaps |
| 28–32px | Desktop page inset and hero spacing |
| 40–48px | Page bottom breathing room |

**Transfer recommendation:** expose these values as spacing tokens in the receiving system while keeping the original proportions. Do not force every dimension onto a new scale if visual fidelity is the goal.

| Token / shape | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--radius-sm` | 6px | Buttons, inputs, tabs' surrounding surfaces, callouts, menus |
| `--radius` | 10px | Cards, KPI tiles, grouped content |
| `--radius-lg` | 14px | Dialogs |
| Small local radius | 4px | Keyboard keys, focus outline shape, chart bar ends |
| Pill radius | 999px | Badges, chips, progress tracks, lesson steps |

| Token | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--shadow-sm` | `0 1px 2px rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.06)` | Same as light |
| `--shadow` | `0 2px 8px rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.08), 0 1px 2px rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.06)` | `0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45)` |
| `--shadow-lg` | `0 12px 32px rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.16)` | `0 16px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)` |
| `--focus-ring` | `0 0 0 3px rgba(31, 95, 139, 0.35)` | `0 0 0 3px rgba(90, 167, 216, 0.45)` |

Use a 1px border for most surface separation. Cards have the smallest shadow; hovered linked cards and toasts use the medium shadow; menus and dialogs use the large shadow.

## 5. Layout and responsive behavior

### Application shell

- Full-height shell with a left navigation column and a flexible main region.
- Expanded navigation is `232px`; collapsed navigation is `64px`.
- Brand row and workspace toolbar share a `56px` height token. The toolbar can grow when controls wrap.
- Navigation uses an elevated background and a right border. Group headings organize related tasks; utility actions sit at the bottom.
- Navigation links use `8px 10px` padding, a `10px` icon gap, and a `6px` radius. Selection uses primary text on a primary-soft background.
- Standard pages scroll inside the main region, with `28px 32px 48px` padding. Narrow pages are centered with a maximum width of `1080px`.
- Page headers place a title and description on the left and actions on the right, with wrapping and a `16px` gap.

### Page compositions

| Composition | Structure |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Header → action or workflow cards → recent work / progress |
| Card collection | Auto-fill columns, minimum `260px`, `16px` gaps |
| Editor | Toolbar → flexible canvas + `420px` inspector |
| Configuration and results | `380px` configuration column + flexible results, `20px` gap |
| Reference content | `280px` sticky index + flexible article, `24px` gap |
| Dashboard | KPI grid → chart cards → detailed tables |

Use `minmax(0, 1fr)`, `min-width: 0`, and `min-height: 0` in flexible workspaces so wide content and nested scrolling do not force the shell to expand.

### Existing breakpoints

| Maximum viewport width | Adaptation |
| --- | --- |
| 1100px | Inspector narrows to `340px`; configuration/results layout becomes one column |
| 960px | Two-column home hero becomes one column |
| 900px | Two- and three-column utility grids become one column; reference index moves above content |
| 820px | Sidebar becomes a horizontal, scrollable navigation row; labels and group headings are hidden; page padding becomes `18px 16px 40px`; inspector moves below the canvas |

At the smallest editor breakpoint, canvas and inspector rows are defined as `minmax(320px, 1fr)` and `minmax(280px, 45vh)`. This is a dense workspace layout. **Transfer recommendation:** check the receiving app's smallest supported screen and scrolling behavior instead of assuming these minimum heights fit every phone.

## 6. Component recipes

### Buttons and inputs

| Component | Geometry and treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default button | `34px` high, `0 12px` padding, `6px` gap and radius, 1px border, elevated fill, weight 550 |
| Small button | `28px` high, `0 8px` padding, 13px text |
| Icon button | Square `34px`; small version `28px` |
| Primary button | Primary fill and border, text-on-primary foreground |
| Secondary button | Default bordered button; hover uses bg-hover and border-strong |
| Ghost button | Transparent fill and border; bg-hover on hover |
| Danger button | Error-colored text with the base button treatment |
| Selected button | Primary-soft fill, primary text and border |
| Input / select | `34px` high, `0 10px` padding, 6px radius, elevated fill, 1px border |
| Small input / select | `28px` high, `0 6px` padding, 13px text |
| Textarea | Auto height, `8px 10px` padding, vertical resize |

Disabled buttons use 50% opacity and a not-allowed cursor. Focused inputs use a primary border and the focus-ring shadow. Form fields stack label, control, and hint with a `4px` gap and `12px` separation between fields. Responsive field rows have `10px` gaps and minimum `120px` columns.

**Transfer recommendation:** give each task group one visually dominant action. Use labels with concrete verbs, such as “Run simulation,” “Import file,” or “Save changes.” Give accent and danger variants explicit hover styles if using them in the receiving app; the current stylesheet lets them inherit the base button hover.

### Cards, lists, and selection

- Standard card: elevated background, 1px border, 10px radius, 18px padding, smallest shadow.
- Card title row: aligned title and utility action, 8px gap, 12px bottom spacing.
- Linked card hover: primary border and medium shadow. No actual translation or scaling is applied.
- Compact rows: small outline icon, label, optional metadata or trailing action; bg-hover signals interaction.
- Selected rows and options: primary-soft background with a primary outline where appropriate.
- Collection preview cards: `140px` preview region separated by a bottom border, followed by `12px 14px` body padding.

### Tabs, chips, and badges

- Tabs sit above a 1px bottom divider. Each tab has `9px 12px` padding, a `6px` icon gap, and weight 550. Selection uses primary text and a 2px bottom border.
- Tab strips scroll horizontally when needed. Inspector tabs are denser: 13px text and `10px 8px` padding.
- Filter chips use `3px 9px` padding, 12px text, a pill radius, and a 1px border. Selection adds primary-soft fill, primary border, and primary text.
- Status badges are `20px` high with `0 7px` padding, 11px text, weight 650, and a pill radius. Semantic variants use matching foreground/soft pairs and transparent borders.

### Feedback and progress

- Callouts use `10px 12px` padding, a 6px radius, an 18px leading icon, and a `10px` content gap. Semantic borders mix the role color with transparency: 30% for informational callouts and 35% for warning, error, and success.
- Validation rows use a 3px inset severity stripe, a severity icon, a short title, and expandable explanatory content. Explanations connect the problem to its consequence and a possible fix.
- Empty states are centered with `36px 16px` padding, a muted icon, a short heading, and helpful next-step content.
- Progress tracks are `8px` high, pill-shaped, and sunken; fills use primary color.
- Toasts stack at the bottom right, `16px` from the edges, with an `8px` gap. Each has `10px 14px` padding, 6px radius, medium shadow, and a 4px primary or semantic left border. Current widths are `260–420px`.

### Tables and metrics

- Wrap tables in a horizontally scrollable container with a 1px border and 6px radius.
- Body text is 13px; sticky header text is 12px, weight 600, muted, on bg-subtle.
- Cells use `7px 10px` padding and horizontal separators. Hover highlights the entire row.
- Right-align numeric columns and use tabular numerals. Keep units visible and number formatting consistent.
- KPI grids use minimum `170px` columns and `12px` gaps. Tiles use `12px 14px` padding, 10px radius, and a 1px border.
- KPI hierarchy: 12px muted label → 22px bold value → 11px subtle supporting detail. Outcome deltas use semantic colors and weight 650.

### Dialogs and menus

- Dialog backdrop: `rgba(10, 16, 24, 0.5)`, centered layout, `24px` viewport padding.
- Dialog: elevated fill, 1px border, 14px radius, large shadow, width `min(960px, 100%)`, maximum height `calc(100vh - 48px)`.
- Header: `14px 18px` padding and bottom divider. Body: 18px padding and vertical scrolling. Footer: `12px 18px` padding, top divider, actions aligned right with an 8px gap.
- Menus: minimum `230px` width, 6px radius, large shadow, 4px outer padding, 4px below their trigger. Items use `7px 10px` padding.
- Existing layer order: watermark 10, canvas controls 15, canvas overlay 20, menus 30, dialogs 50, toasts 60, skip link 100.

## 7. Icons and brand treatment

Use Lucide outline icons for application actions and navigation. Common sizes are 16px in buttons, 18px in navigation and callouts, and 13–14px in small inline actions. Keep icons aligned to text and usually inherit the surrounding foreground color.

The navigation brand uses a `30px` primary-colored square with an `8px` radius, containing a `20px` monochrome mark. The wordmark is 15px and its supporting line is 11px. The BPMN mark uses simple connected geometric forms with 2px strokes.

When transferring the language, retain the compact mark/wordmark proportions and outline-icon treatment while replacing the BPMN symbol with a mark appropriate to the new product. Domain notation icons belong inside domain content, separate from navigation icons.

## 8. Data visualization

Charts have a separate categorical palette. Do not use category colors to imply success, warning, or failure.

| Token | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--chart-1` | `#2a78d6` | `#3987e5` |
| `--chart-2` | `#eb6834` | `#d95926` |
| `--chart-3` | `#1baf7a` | `#199e70` |
| `--chart-grid` | `#e1e0d9` | `#2c2c2a` |
| `--chart-axis` | `#c3c2b7` | `#383835` |
| `--chart-muted` | `#898781` | `#898781` |
| `--chart-surface` | `#ffffff` | `#171e27` |

Additional status-scale tokens stay the same in both themes: `--status-good: #0ca30c`, `--status-warning: #fab219`, `--status-serious: #ec835a`, and `--status-critical: #d03b3b`.

- Place charts in bordered cards with a title, concise subtitle including units, and a legend for multiple series.
- Use one value axis per chart, light grid lines, no tick marks, and 11px axis text; categorical labels commonly use 12px.
- Use horizontal bars for named categories. Bars generally have a maximum thickness of 24px; paired bars use 18px. Round exposed ends by 4px.
- Use 2px lines. Area fills use 10% opacity. Step curves represent discrete changes; continuous trends may use smooth lines.
- Tooltips match the card palette with a 6px radius, `8px 10px` padding, 12px text, and medium shadow.
- Present a table view alongside chart-based analysis. Labels, units, legends, and numeric values carry meaning as well as color.
- Resolve chart colors from theme tokens and refresh them when the theme changes. Keep a series' identity consistent across related views.

## 9. Embedded workspace surfaces

These tokens are specific to the diagram workspace but can inform an editor, map, or other visual tool in the receiving app:

| Token | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--canvas-bg` | `#ffffff` | `#141a22` |
| `--bpmn-stroke` | `#22242a` | `#d7dee8` |
| `--bpmn-fill` | `#ffffff` | `#1b232d` |
| `--bpmn-label` | `#22242a` | `#e6ebf1` |

Keep the canvas visually quiet and place dense explanations in the adjacent inspector. Use orange outlines to draw attention to a selected explanation or issue location. Compact embedded viewers have a 1px border, 6px radius, and a typical height of 260px, or 360px for the tall variant.

BPMN Studio themes default diagram colors while preserving user-assigned colors. Its third-party controls receive matching surface, text, border, and focus values. Transfer this principle to embedded tools instead of recoloring every element indiscriminately. The BPMN-specific selectors and renderer color sentinels are implementation details, not required parts of the general design language.

## 10. Theme, motion, and accessibility

The theme model supports `light`, `dark`, and `system`. The resolved theme is applied as `data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"` on the root element. CSS also supplies a system-dark fallback when an explicit light theme is absent. The visible toggle switches between light and dark; the theme layer stores the preference and observes system changes.

Motion is brief and functional:

| Interaction | Existing timing |
| --- | --- |
| Button background and border | 120ms |
| Linked-card border and shadow | 120ms |
| Toast appearance | 180ms ease-out, fading in from 8px below |
| Progress width | 250ms |
| Loading spinner | 1s linear, repeating |

The app includes a visible keyboard focus treatment, a skip-to-content link, semantic navigation, labeled dialog and progress primitives, and selected-state attributes on tabs. Dialogs focus themselves when opened, close on Escape, and restore previous focus when closed.

**Transfer recommendations:** preserve these foundations and complete interaction behavior in the receiving app. The existing shared dialog does not implement focus trapping, tabs do not implement arrow-key navigation, and the styles do not include a reduced-motion override. Add those behaviors where applicable. Give every icon-only control an accessible name, including when responsive styles hide its text. Review text contrast, touch hit areas, toast widths, zoom/reflow, and both themes in the destination layout; this guide is a visual specification, not an accessibility certification.

## 11. Content and voice

Use direct, instructional language. Prefer a clear action and an explanation of what happens next. Keep headings short, descriptions informative, and implementation terminology out of ordinary task flows.

- Actions: “Open the modeler,” “Continue learning,” “Run simulation.”
- Empty states: state what is missing, then give a useful next step.
- Errors: identify the problem, explain the consequence, and offer a fix.
- Results: show the value, its unit, and relevant context or uncertainty.
- Learning feedback: make progress and correctness understandable through words and icons as well as color.

Transfer the tone and hierarchy while replacing BPMN-specific labels with the receiving product's vocabulary.

## 12. Transfer checklist and source map

1. Establish the light/dark tokens, font stacks, border treatment, radii, and shadows before styling individual pages.
2. Rebuild the shell and one representative content page at the original density.
3. Implement shared buttons, inputs, cards, tabs, badges, callouts, tables, dialogs, and feedback states.
4. Apply the same tokens to charts and embedded tools. Verify normal, hover, selected, focused, disabled, empty, loading, success, and error states.
5. Check desktop, the documented breakpoints, and the smallest supported viewport in both themes, using realistic content lengths.
6. Replace product-specific branding, routes, storage keys, examples, and domain content. Keep reusable visual rules independent of BPMN dependencies.
